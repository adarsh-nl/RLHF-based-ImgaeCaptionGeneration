#**Cost Function Documentation**

**Introduction**

> This documentation provides a general framework for designing a cost function
that maximizes human feedback using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to fine-tune a model based on human preferences.


**Components**

**1. Supervised Learning Component**

> The supervised learning component focuses on utilizing human feedback through explicit annotations. It uses a dataset of image-caption pairs, where each image has one or more corresponding captions. The goal is to compute a supervised loss by comparing the model's generated caption to the human-provided caption.


```
Inputs
C_model: The generated caption by the model.
C_human: The human-provided caption.
```

>>**Loss Calculation:**
A loss function, such as cross-entropy loss or mean squared error can be employed to measure the discrepancy between the generated caption and the human-provided caption.

```
Supervised Loss = Loss(C_model, C_human)
```
**2.Reinforcement Learning Component**

>The reinforcement learning component focuses on learning from human feedback in the form of rewards. Instead of relying solely on explicit annotations, it collects binary feedback from human evaluators indicating whether the generated caption is good or bad. Based on this feedback, it assigns a reward value.

**Inputs**

>**R:** The reward value assigned based on human feedback (+1 for good, -1 for bad).

>**α:** The weight (hyperparameter) controlling the importance of the supervised loss.

>**β:** The weight (hyperparameter) controlling the importance of the reinforcement reward.

**Cost Function Integration**

>To combine the supervised learning and reinforcement learning components, a weighted combination of the supervised loss and the reinforcement reward is used. This allows for the incorporation of both explicit annotations and human preferences.

**Cost Function Calculation**

>The cost function is formulated as follows:

```
Cost = α * Supervised Loss - β * R
#The α and β hyperparameters can be adjusted to emphasize one component over the other based on specific requirements and domain knowledge.
```
**3.Optimization**

>The optimization of the cost function is typically performed using gradient-based methods, such as stochastic gradient descent. By updating the model weights based on the gradients of the cost function, the goal is to maximize the human feedback and improve the model's performance.
